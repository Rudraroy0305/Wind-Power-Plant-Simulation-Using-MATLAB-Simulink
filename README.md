A simulation-based study of a 1.5 MW induction generator wind turbine model developed in MATLAB Simulink. The project analyzes turbine performance by varying wind speed to observe changes in power, torque, and efficiency, and compares results against the theoretical Betz limit. It demonstrates how Simulink can model and visualize real-time wind energy conversion dynamics and efficiency optimization.
